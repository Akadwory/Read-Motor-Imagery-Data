# Read-Motor-Imagery-Data

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for the analysis of motor imagery EEG data using advanced machine learning and signal processing techniques. The code is designed to preprocess EEG data, extract meaningful features, and build a robust classification model to differentiate between different motor imagery tasks.

Project Overview
The project is structured to provide a complete workflow from raw EEG data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The main steps include:
Data Preprocessing:
Band-Pass Filtering: We apply a band-pass filter to isolate the frequency bands most relevant to motor imagery tasks (8-30 Hz).
Artifact Removal with ICA: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is used to remove common EEG artifacts, such as eye blinks, ensuring cleaner data for further analysis.

Feature Extraction:
Common Spatial Patterns (CSP): CSP is utilized to extract spatial features from the EEG data that maximize the distinction between different motor imagery tasks.

Time-Frequency Analysis (PSD): Power Spectral Density (PSD) features are computed to capture the frequency-domain characteristics of the EEG signals, providing additional insights into the neural oscillations during motor imagery.

Model Building:
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier: A linear SVM classifier is trained on the extracted features to classify the motor imagery tasks. The model is validated using cross-validation to ensure its robustness and generalization.

Visualization:
Topographical Mapping: The pipeline includes visualization of the EEG data through topographical maps, allowing for a spatial understanding of the neural activity associated with each motor imagery task.

Key Functions
preprocessing_eeg(raw): Preprocesses the raw EEG data by filtering and applying ICA to remove artifacts.
motor_img_reading(path): Reads and epochs the EEG data, extracting labels and raw features.
extract_features(epochs): Applies CSP and computes PSD to extract and combine the most relevant features for classification.
train_model(features, labels): Trains an SVM classifier using the extracted features and evaluates its performance with cross-validation.
plot_topomap(epochs): Visualizes the spatial distribution of the EEG activity through topographical maps.

How to Use

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The raw EEG data is loaded from a .gdf file and preprocessed to remove artifacts. This step ensures that only relevant neural signals are retained for analysis.
Feature Extraction:
The preprocessed data is transformed using CSP to enhance spatial features, followed by the calculation of PSD to capture the frequency content of the signals.
Model Training:
The extracted features are used to train an SVM classifier, which is optimized through cross-validation to achieve high accuracy in classifying motor imagery tasks.
Visualization:
The topographical maps provide a visual representation of the EEG data, helping to understand the neural activity patterns associated with different tasks.
Requirements
Python 3.6+
Libraries: MNE, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
